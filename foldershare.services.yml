services:

#
# Breadcrumbs builder.
# --------------------
# The breadcrumb builder responds on module entity view pages, edit pages,
# and command forms, to build a breadcrumb based on the root-to-entity
# folder path.
#
  foldershare.breadcrumb:
    class: Drupal\foldershare\Entity\Builder\FolderShareBreadcrumbBuilder
    arguments: ['@entity.manager', '@router.route_provider', '@access_manager', '@current_user']
    tags:
      - { name: breadcrumb_builder, priority: 100000 }

#
# FolderShare commands.
# ---------------------
# Commands are similar to Drupal actions, but they include multiple standard
# arguments (e.g. parent, selection) and detailed context information
# (e.g. 'upload' only works when viewing a folder). Command execution requires
# forwarding a command choice and parameters from the UI to code managed by the
# command plugin manager.
#
  foldershare.plugin.manager.foldersharecommand:
    class: Drupal\foldershare\Plugin\FolderShareCommandManager
    arguments: ['@container.namespaces', '@cache.discovery', '@module_handler']
